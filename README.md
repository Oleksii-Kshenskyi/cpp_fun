# C++ is fun! I hope...


An attempt to have fun with C++. Specifically, to write a short library that would allow me to program in a functional style.

# Some details

- This library is meant to be a single compilation unit, meaning, header only (plus the examples .cpp files).
- I'll attempt to write several most important functional algorithms and concepts and try using them for a couple small applications.
- This is a no-strings-attached repository. By this I mean that there are no serious plans for implementing a production-grade library or for long-term support, this is just an experiment to figure out whether C++ can be fun for me at all or not.

# Licensing

This library is licensed under The Unlicense, which means that it's public domain. You can do whatever you want with it and you don't owe me anything, not even any copyright. This is an explicit permission to do whatever you want with this code.
